Code to Abstract Syntax Trees
---

This repository holds the files used to 1) convert Java code into Abstract Syntax Trees with JavaParser and 2) calculate the distance between two such trees using the algorithms proposed by Kaizhong Zhang and Dennis Shasha in 1989. The purpose of this project is to calculate distances between different code files in an attempt to utilize the distance as a metric of creativity in programming.
