```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Importing necessary packages

```{r}
library(hopkins)
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Loading Data

```{r }
data <-
  list.files(path=getwd(), pattern = "*.csv") %>%
  map_df(~fread(.))
df <- data[,-c(0:2)]
final <- df[,c(9)]
final
H <- hopkins(final, m=(nrow(final)*0.05), k=2)
H
```
The above result shows that the Hopkins Statistic for All Submitted Programs is extremely high and indicates that the data, specifically the average z-score/creativity metric, is highly clustered. 

```{r}
format(hopkins.pval(0.9777268, (nrow(final)*0.05)), scientific=T)
```
As shown above, the p-value of the calculated Hopkins statistic is extremely low to the point where it is rounded off to 0. This shows that the data is extremely likely to have a high clustering tendency.
